    <p align = "center">Russia has “lost nothing” in its “special military operation” in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin claimed in his</br> speech to open the Plenary Session at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Wednesday.</p></br>
    <p align = "center">“We have lost nothing and are not going to lose anything. Our main gain is the strengthening of our </br>sovereignty. We didn’t start anything, in terms of military action, but are only trying to finish it,” Putin told the</br> audience.</p>
    <p align = "center">Based on downgraded intelligence, the US believes that Russia is facing “severe” shortages of military</br> personnel in Ukraine and is seeking new ways to reinforce its troop levels, two US officials told CNN last</br> week. </p></br>
    <p align = "center">In a statement Monday, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said that it is now estimated that “over 25,000 </br>Russian soldiers have lost their lives” since the start of the war. </p></br>
    <p align = "Center">In late August, President Putin ordered Russia’s military to increase the number of troops in Ukraine by </br>137,000, though it remains unclear how the Defense Ministry intends to reach that target.</p></br></br>
