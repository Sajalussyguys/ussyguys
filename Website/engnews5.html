        <h1 align = "center">A brutal heat wave brings record highs in the 110s and </br>threatens power outages across California. And a </br>hurricane could prolong it</h1></br></br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src = "huh.jpg" width = "600" height = "400"></br></br>
        <p align = "center">A record-breaking heat wave has baked the West for days -- fueling destructive</br> wildfires and threatening rolling power shutoffs in California -- and it could last even longer due </br>to the effects of a hurricane forming along Mexico's Pacific Coast.</p></br>
        <p align = "Center">Sacramento hit 116 degrees Tuesday, the hottest day on record for the state capital, according </br>to the National Weather Service. Records were also broken all over the Bay Area, with some </br>cities shattering previous daily records by more than 10 degrees.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">"We are now heading into the worst part of it -- the risk of outages is real," California Gov. Gavin</br> Newsom said in a tweet Tuesday, adding that the temperatures in the state are </br>"unprecedented."</p></br>
        <p align = "center">The heat wave will be the hottest and longest on record for California for September, he said.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">California residents have for days been urged to set thermostats </br>to 78 degrees or higher -- despite the heat -- as well as avoid using major appliances, and </br>turn off all unnecessary lights between the hours of 4 p.m. and 9 p.m.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">Pacific Gas & Electric, the nation's largest utility, </br>has notified about 525,000 customers to </br>prepare for potential rotating outages.</p></br>
        <p align = "Center">The California Independent System Operator -- which manages most of the state's power grid --</br> issued an emergency alert for Tuesday evening, saying grid conditions had worsened and</br> energy supplies were insufficient to cover demand. The alert was lifted hours later and the </br>operator thanked "consumer conservation."</p></br>
        <p align = "center">While relief was expected Thursday, the oppressive heat is now expected to last through at least </br>Friday.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">Hurricane Kay will bring strong rains and high winds to the Mexican coast, but far from its center, </br>the storm will also dictate the weather pattern for Southern California.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">Kay will still be about 220 miles south of San Diego on Friday, according to the National Weather </br>Service in Los Angeles, but the flow around the storm will bring easterly winds to the area, which</br> could bring extreme heat all the way down to the beaches.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">The weather service in San Diego extended the excessive heat warning for the region through </br>Friday to account for the possibility of high temperatures well into the</br> 90s to 100 reaching the coast.</p></br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src = "idkwhatisthis.jpg" width = "600" height = "400"></br></br>
        <h3 align = "center">Scorching hot temperatures shatter records</h3></br></br>
        <p align = "center">Numerous heat records have been set across the West, according to the weather service.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">In California, San Francisco airport hit 97 degrees Monday, breaking a daily record. Salinas hit</br> 103 degrees, shattering the previous record of 92 degrees set in 2004. Livermore hit a record </br>high of 116.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">Salt Lake City hit 104 Monday, the hottest September day </br>on record and also the 32nd day this year with temperatures reaching at least </br>100 degrees, beating the previous record by 11 days.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">Temperatures in Billings, Montana, reached 100 degrees Monday</br>, which tied a previous record. This was the first time Billings </br>has hit 100 degrees twice in the same September.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">Scientists say searing heat is part of a global pattern of rising </br>temperatures, and climate change is making heat waves hotter and</br> more frequent.   </p></br>
        <p align = "Center">Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have heated</br> the planet by about 1.2 Celsius since pre-industrial times and</br> that warmer baseline means higher temperatures can be reached during extreme heat events,</br> scientists say.</p></br>
        <h3 align = "center">Wildfires ignited throughout the West</h3></br></br>
        <p align = "center">The hot and dry conditions also mean that fires will spread more quickly, rage more intensely </br>and burn for longer.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">Several destructive wildfires erupted over the past week, with at least four people dying in two </br>California blazes that also burned homes and thousands of acres of land.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">The fires, burning simultaneously in parched drought-stricken lands, have choked the hot </br>atmosphere with smoke, bringing unhealthy air quality to parts of the Western states.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">The thick smoke, billowing from numerous wildfires, is visible from space, according to images </br>released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</p></br>
        <p align = "center">The fires have also displaced thousands of residents as the flames advanced on communities,</br> slashing through dry vegetation, and burning homes and cars.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">Two people were killed as the fast-moving Fairview Fire swelled rapidly over parched vegetation </br>in Southern California on Monday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee. The blaze had burned </br>4,500 acres by Tuesday and was 5% contained.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">To the north, in Siskiyou County, two women, ages 66 and 73, died in the Mill Fire that </br>burned 4,263 acres and destroyed 98 structures as of Tuesday night.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">Nearby, the Mountain Fire, also burning in Siskiyou County, tore through 11,690 acres.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">In Oregon, the Cedar Creek Fire had consumed 17,625 acres in five days after</br> being sparked by lightning, authorities said.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">Meanwhile, the Ross Fork Fire in Idaho that ignited in mid-August </br>continues to burn and has engulfed 26,020 acres. Firefighters had it </br>2% contained Tuesday.</p></br></br>
