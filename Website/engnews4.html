        <h1 align = "center">Apple set to unveil iPhone 14 at ‘far out’ event</h1></br></br>
        <h3 align = "center">iPhone 14 expected to take center stage</h3></br></br>
        <p align = "Center">Apple is widely expected to give a first look at its latest iPhone lineup on Wednesday, as the tech giant has </br>done every year in September for about a decade.</p></br>
        <p align = "Center">The latest iPhone is expected to be slimmer, but with a larger screen. It’s rumored that Apple will debut a 6.7-</br>inch phone that is not a Pro model – meaning it will have the bigger size but not carry the higher price tag.</br> That much-disliked notch around the front-facing camera system is also expected to go away. And Apple </br>watchers forecast the company will ditch its cheaper, mini-sized iPhone as part of the 14 lineup.</p></br>
        <p align = "Center">Finally, expect a potentially major upgrade to camera quality with the latest iPhones, as some Apple watchers</br> predict the 14 lineup will be the first of the company’s flagship smartphones to shoot 8K video.</p></br>
        <p align = "Center">It’s not just the iPhone. Apple is rumored to be unveiling multiple new Apple Watch models at Wednesday’s</br> event, including a higher-end Pro model aimed specifically at sports and fitness enthusiasts.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">Apple is also reportedly planning to roll out upgraded AirPod Pros, its higher-end wireless earbuds. The</br> AirPods line has proven to be one of Apple’s bigger breakout successes in recent years.</p></br>
        <p align = "Center">While the iPhone 14 is expected to be front and center, some other hardware announcements are less likely.</p></br>
        <p align = "center">Many analysts believe Apple will wait to unveil new iPads and Mac computers at a separate event, possibly</br> next month. Apple is also generally not expected to unveil its long-rumored and much-anticipated AR headset.</p></br></br>
